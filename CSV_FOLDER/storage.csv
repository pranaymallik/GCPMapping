This value is measured once per day, and the value is repeated at each sampling interval throughout the day. For this metric, the sampling period is a reporting period, not a measurement period. Sampled every 300 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 600 seconds."
gcp.storage.storage.total_bytes,Total bytes,GAUGE,DOUBLE,By,gcs_bucket,"Total size of all objects in the bucket, grouped by storage class. This value is measured once per day, and the value is repeated at each sampling interval throughout the day. For this metric, the sampling period is a reporting period, not a measurement period. Sampled every 300 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 600 seconds."

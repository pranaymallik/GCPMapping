gcp.run.container.billable_instance_time,Billable Instance Time,DELTA,DOUBLE,s,cloud_run_revision,"Billable time aggregated from all container instances of the revision. For a given container instance, billable time occurs when the container instance is starting or at least one request is being processed. Billable time is rounded up to the nearest 100 milliseconds. Examples: If a revision with 2 container instances has been continuously serving traffic in the last minute, the value is 2s/s with the default ""rate"" aligner. If a single request lasting 30ms was received by a revision in the past minute, it is rounded up to 100ms and averaged to 1.7ms/s over the minute with the default ""rate"" aligner. Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 180 seconds."
gcp.run.container.cpu.allocation_time,Container CPU Allocation,DELTA,DOUBLE,s{CPU},cloud_run_revision,"Container CPU allocation of the revision in seconds. Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 180 seconds."
gcp.run.container.cpu.utilizations,Container CPU Utilization,DELTA,DISTRIBUTION,10^2.%,cloud_run_revision,"Container CPU utilization distribution across all container instances of the revision. Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 60 seconds."
gcp.run.container.instance_count,Instance Count,GAUGE,INT64,1,cloud_run_revision,"Number of container instances that exist, broken down by state. Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 180 seconds."
gcp.run.container.max_request_concurrencies,Max Concurrent Requests,DELTA,DISTRIBUTION,1,cloud_run_revision,"Distribution of the maximum number number of concurrent requests being served by each container instance over a minute. Filter by 'state' = 'active' only get the concurrency of active container instances. Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 180 seconds."
gcp.run.container.memory.allocation_time,Container Memory Allocation,DELTA,DOUBLE,GiBy.s,cloud_run_revision,"Container memory allocation of the revision in Gigabytes-seconds. Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 180 seconds."
gcp.run.container.memory.utilizations,Container Memory Utilization,DELTA,DISTRIBUTION,10^2.%,cloud_run_revision,"Container memory utilization distribution across all container instances of the revision. Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 60 seconds."
gcp.run.container.network.received_bytes_count,Received Bytes,DELTA,INT64,By,cloud_run_revision,"Incoming socket and HTTP response traffic of revision, in bytes. Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 180 seconds."
gcp.run.container.network.sent_bytes_count,Sent Bytes,DELTA,INT64,By,cloud_run_revision,"Outgoing socket and HTTP response traffic of revision, in bytes. Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 180 seconds."
gcp.run.request_count,Request Count,DELTA,INT64,1,cloud_run_revision,"Number of requests reaching the revision. Excludes requests that are not reaching your container instances (e.g. unauthorized requests or when maximum number of instances is reached). Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 180 seconds."
gcp.run.request_latencies,Request Latency,DELTA,DISTRIBUTION,ms,cloud_run_revision,"Distribution of request latency in milliseconds reaching the revision. Sampled every 60 seconds. After sampling, data is not visible for up to 180 seconds."
